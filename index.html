                <p>In today's connected world, organizations face a constant threat of cyber attacks and data breaches. To protect sensitive systems and data from external threats, it's essential to have a secure and reliable way to access private networks from external networks. This is where bastion hosts come into play.  But what if every time a user connected to one of these hosts, a new clean and sanitized environment was presented to them?</p>

                <p>XXE attacks occur when an attacker can inject XML data into an application that is processed by an XML parser without proper validation or sanitization. This can result in an attacker gaining access to sensitive data or executing arbitrary code on the affected system.  This post goes through the different types and vectors commonly used in XXE attacks</p>

            <a href="https://github.com/f8al/DNSRazzle">DNSrazzle</a>'s DNS fuzzing is an automated workflow for discovering potentially malicious domains targeting your organisation. This tool works by using dnstwists permutation engine to generating a large list of permutations based on a domain name you provide, and then checking if any of those permutations are in use. Additionally, it generates screenshots of the original domain, and the discovered web pages, and compares them using computer vision to see if they are part of an ongoing phishing attack or brand impersonation campaign.  This tool is currently in use by multiple companies worldwide.

            <a href="https://github.com/f8al/TA-Shell">TA-Shell</a> is a Splunk app that utilizes the remote code execution (RCE) features of Splunk scripted and modular inputs for opening a reverse shell on a remote forwarder.  This tool was developed with 2 purposes in mind, 1) Being able to get a remote commandline from any device in a splunk cluster or on the network managed by a deployment-server to fix issues when other forms of access are not available, and 2) Red Team engagements, by ARP Spoofing as the deployment server on the network, a red teamer can push this to any system managed by the deployment server on the network and gain a shell as whatever user splunk is running as, and since Splunk doesent support CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH in posix systems, theres a good possibility that that shell will be root on *nix systems.

                    <ul>
           <a href="https://github.com/f8al/fuzzy-guacamole">Fuzzy-Guacamole</a> was a tool born out of necessity.  As a remote employee a strong internet connection is paramount.  When your ISP refuses to fix your connection, sometimes you have to do what you have to do to get them to pay attention to you.  This tool is to be run on a Raspberry pi hardwired to, or on a linux based router.  At a programmable interval it will run a speedtest using the speedtest.net python module.  If the speeds returned are below a configurable threshold, it will tweet at your ISP's twitter account your current speed, and what percentage that is of your paid SLA.  If your speeds are above the threshold, it does nothing until the next run.

            Brand impersonation, phishing, and business email compromise are complex problems with no easy solutions.  This talk centers around how you can use computer vision in python to compare known good domains, and the content hosted on them, to imposter domains using such techniques a homoglyphs, typosquatting, vowel-swapping, and UTF-8 character space swaps just to name a few.<br>
